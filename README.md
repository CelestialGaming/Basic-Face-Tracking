# Basic-Face-Tracking

Welcome to my first solo project! I was inspired to create this project after watching a video on YouTube that piqued my interest. Check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfbqZ3wa_fU

This project is designed to track your face, and I've separated it into individual steps, each contained in its own file. You'll find these files numbered and titled as "Object Tracking Test."

# Dependencies:
To use this project, you'll need to have OpenCV or CV2 installed. I also used enespolat25's repository for the XML file, which is included in this project.

# Programs used:
I created this project using PyCharm

# What's broken:
Please note that the "pseyecam" element is a separate project that I might move to a different repository. For now, please disregard it.

Liscense:

Choose Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal because I don't mind if people use it for anything, I just want some credit back :)

# Author's notes
Please note that this code may not be fully optimized or streamlined, as it was developed by an amateur programmer with a passion for coding. As such, there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same results. However, this project is intended to serve as a learning opportunity and a demonstration of basic quadratic equation concepts.
